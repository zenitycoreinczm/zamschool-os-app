# Security

This document describes the security model: who can do what, where the checks live, and how the audits are run. For the data layer details, see [DATA.md](./DATA.md). For findings, see [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md).

## Threat model

You should treat every page as if it were public. The application is multi-tenant: every school is a tenant, every user belongs to one school, and every query is scoped to a school. The two threats you are defending against are cross-tenant reads and cross-tenant writes. Cross-role actions (a teacher acting as a parent) are a secondary concern.

## Layers

Security is enforced at four layers. You must satisfy all of them; none is sufficient on its own.

1. **Postgres RLS.** Every production table has row-level security enabled. Policies check role from `auth.jwt()` and school from the user's profile. Personal data is additionally scoped to `user_id`. The current policy taxonomy lives inline in the baseline migration (`supabase/migrations/00000000000000_baseline.sql`) under each table's `create policy` statements.
2. **API route guards.** Every API route under `app/api/*` calls `requireActorContext` or a role-specific guard (`requireTeacherContext`, `requireParentContext`, `requireStudentContext`) before reading or writing. The guards throw and return 401/403 if the user is missing or wrong-role.
3. **Shell guards.** Each shell checks the user's role on mount and redirects away from paths that belong to a different role. `AdminShell` does this in `resolveWorkspaceRedirect` (`AdminShell.tsx`).
4. **Rate limiting.** MFA routes, login, and password-reset are rate-limited with fail-closed semantics. The helper lives in `lib/auth-api-rate-limit.ts`.

## Service role

The Supabase service role bypasses RLS. You should treat it as privileged and rare. Every use of the service role is audited by `npm run audit:tenant`. The strict variant (`npm run audit:tenant:strict`) fails the build if any service-role query touches a tenant-scoped table without an explicit school filter. You should not add new service-role queries; if you think you need one, write a Postgres function with `security definer` instead.

## Auth

Auth is Supabase-managed. MFA supports TOTP factors (`enroll`, `verify`, `challenge`, `factor list`, `factor delete`). The MFA routes are tested in `__tests__/app/api/auth/mfa/route.test.mjs`. The first-login flow forces a password change before the workspace becomes reachable (`app/first-login/page.tsx`). Session switching on the login page revalidates the session before showing the workspace button.

## Tenant audit

Two checks are wired into `package.json` and CI:

- `npm run audit:tenant` — read-only scan of every server file. Lists every place that imports the service-role client and flags any query without a `school_id` guard.
- `npm run audit:tenant:strict` — same scan, but exits non-zero if it finds a service-role query that does not pass `school_id` to the database. Run this in CI before any merge. Currently reports 0 findings.

## What you should not do

You should not log full request bodies. You should not echo back Supabase tokens in error messages. You should not cache sensitive payloads at the edge with a long TTL — keep `Cache-Control: private, no-store` for anything tied to a user's profile, children, or finances. You should not store files outside the `authorized` R2 bucket; the upload route validates the entity type against `ALLOWED_ENTITY_TYPES`.

## Reporting

If you find a vulnerability, do not file a public issue. Report it through the team channel used for production sign-off and pause deployment until reviewed.
