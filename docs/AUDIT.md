# Audit

This document records the current state of the ZamSchool OS frontend. It is observational: the agent read each cited file in full, recorded concrete observations with line numbers, and audited the test suite for freshness. You should treat this as a snapshot, not a backlog.

For style and shell patterns, see [UI-UX.md](./UI-UX.md). For architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## How this audit was done

Each file listed under [Done Well](#done-well), [Needs Work](#needs-work), and [Resolved since 2026-06-21](#resolved-since-2026-06-21) was read in full against the working tree. Observations cite specific line numbers from the working tree, not from prior memory. The test suite was opened test-by-test and each assertion was compared against its targeted source.

## Done Well

These observations held under re-verification on 2026-06-28.

1. **Design tokens are centralized.** `app/globals.css:5-65` defines a Tailwind 4 `@theme` block with brand palette, workspace surfaces, radius scale, elevation shadows, and motion easing/duration tokens. Every shell reads from the same source.
2. **Mobile-first responsive shell.** The workspace grid uses `100dvh` and switches sidebar width at the `1024px` breakpoint via the `zamschool-workspace-shell__sidebar` token class (`app/globals.css:159-175`). Main scroll uses `overflow-y: auto` with fluid `clamp()` padding.
3. **Clean micro-hooks.** `hooks/use-mobile.ts` uses functional `setState` and removes the `matchMedia` listener on unmount. `hooks/useReveal.ts` wraps `IntersectionObserver` with configurable threshold, margin, and a `once` flag.
4. **Per-role code splitting.** `components/RoleBasedShell.tsx` dynamic-imports each role shell, so the admin bundle does not pull in the teacher/parent/student/payments shells.
5. **Teacher dashboard correctness.** `components/teacher/dashboard/TeacherDashboard.tsx` is the dashboard entry point after the 2026-06-28 extraction; the prior monolith now lives one level deeper as composable subcomponents.
6. **Static-grep test discipline.** 32 of 32 in-tree static-grep tests (`__tests__/**`) still match the current source (see the table below). The team has avoided the trap of dynamic-execution tests that rot when refactors change internals.
7. **Sanitization at the search boundary.** `lib/workspace-search.ts` exports `sanitizeWorkspaceSearchQuery`, which trims and strips unsafe characters before grouping.
8. **Semantic HTML on the landing page.** `app/page.tsx` uses `<article>` for feature cards, `<blockquote><footer>` for testimonials, and `aria-label="Platform preview"` for the mock UI.
9. **`MobileDock` has a typed contract.** `components/workspace/MobileDock.tsx` exposes `isActive?: (pathname, href) => boolean` with a working default (`defaultIsActive`, prefix-match). All five shells now consume a stable prop shape.
10. **`prefers-reduced-motion` covers the visible motion in the design system.** `app/globals.css:197-213` neutralizes `.animate-enter-up`, `.workspace-loader-dot`, and `.workspace-loader-ring` under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Token transitions remain brief (150–380ms) and respect `ease` timing only, so no vestibular compensation is needed.
11. **Sidebar width is single-sourced.** All five shells use the `zamschool-workspace-shell__sidebar` token class. There are no `w-64` / `w-56` overrides on top of it.
12. **Inbox unread state is event-driven, not set-once.** `components/inbox/WorkspaceInboxCenter.tsx` reads `initialUnread` once at mount and then refreshes via `dispatchInboxRefresh` events and a 10-second cooldown (`lastCountRefreshRef`, line 67-68). `ParentShell.tsx` and `StudentShell.tsx` both seed it from `useWorkspaceContext().unread`.

## User-reported findings (fixed 2026-06-28)

The user reported two specific issues with the head-teacher (principal) Settings page. Both are addressed in this pass and codified by `__tests__/components/principal-settings.test.mjs`.

1. **Principal settings page rendered with the wrong accent.** Before the fix, the principal's Settings nav pointed at `/app/settings` (the admin-level fallback). That fallback uses `accent="emerald"`, while the rest of the principal workspace uses `accent="indigo"` (e.g. `components/admin-workspaces/PrincipalWorkspace.tsx:183`). A head teacher clicking Settings saw an emerald hero against an indigo sidebar — the visual mismatch the user described. **Resolved.** `app/app/principal/settings/page.tsx` is a dedicated orchestrator delegating to `AccountSettingsPage` with `accent="indigo"`, and `lib/workspace-nav.ts:160` (the principal's `Account` section) now links to `/app/principal/settings`.

2. **"Failed to load session" toast on the settings page.** Before the fix, `accountApiJson` ignored the `cause` field that the API returns in non-prod for diagnostics, so the toast always read the generic `"Failed to load session"`. The setting was in two places: `lib/account-portal-api.ts` (the call site that threw the Error) and `components/account/AccountSettingsPage.tsx:94-96` (the catch handler that surfaced the message). **Resolved.** `lib/account-portal-api.ts` now prefers `body.cause || body.error` when building the thrown Error, `app/api/account/session/route.ts` logs to the server console in non-prod on top of returning `cause`, and `AccountSettingsPage.tsx` mirrors the log in the dev console when the request fails. With those changes, the dev/staging toast carries the actual cause (e.g. a column-name mismatch surfaced by `safeErrorMessage`), and the prod toast stays generic so internal column names do not leak.

These are the user-confirmed cases. The same accent inconsistency exists for the other admin subtypes (deputy-head, bursar, guidance, hr-admin, ict-admin, academic-admin, discipline-admin, registrar, payments, super-admin) — the work to add per-role settings pages follows the principal template and is tracked as future work at [Phase 5 of the Implementation Plan](./AUDIT.md#phase-5--per-role-settings-pages).

## Needs Work

These observations are still real against the working tree on 2026-06-28.

1. **Three profile-bootstrap patterns, mostly but not fully unified.** `components/AdminShell.tsx:44`, `components/ParentShell.tsx:38`, `components/StudentShell.tsx:39`, `components/PaymentsShell.tsx:49` all consume `useWorkspaceContext()`. `components/TeacherShell.tsx:58` still wraps content in `TeacherWorkspaceProvider`. The two providers carry different data shapes — `TeacherWorkspaceProvider` owns teacher-specific `stats`, `workload`, and a `refresh()` — so a wholesale merge is not safe today. **The action is to document the boundary** (see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#workspace-bootstrap-providers)) and keep `TeacherWorkspaceProvider` as a thin pass-through that re-uses `useWorkspaceContext` for shared fields.
2. **`TeacherShell` error banner is missing `role="alert"`.** **Resolved in this pass.** `components/TeacherShell.tsx:298` now carries `role="alert"` on the `workspaceError` rose banner, matching the other four shells. Codified in `__tests__/components/shell-a11y.test.mjs` so future regressions are caught.
3. **Audit freshness depends on a manual regen.** `docs/AUDIT.md` and the static-grep test inventory below are both regenerated by hand. Until the regen is software-enforced (an `npm run audit:refresh` script that re-reads each cited file and emits the report), the audit will drift exactly the way [Resolved since 2026-06-21](#resolved-since-2026-06-21) demonstrates.
4. **`lib/` is still one flat folder.** The 130+ files under `lib/` carry accurate names but no subdomain grouping (`lib/attendance/`, `lib/auth/`, `lib/messaging/`, `lib/redis/`, etc.). The guardrail is in place (`eslint-rules/lib-subdomain-policy.mjs` prevents new top-level files; the rule is exercised by `__tests__/lib/lib-subdomain-policy.test.mjs`). The redis cluster has been migrated as the pilot; the remaining ~140 files are tracked under [Implementation Plan → Phase 4](./AUDIT.md#phase-4--lib-subdomain-grouping-pilot-shipped-bulk-migration-open). The cost is real but no longer accumulating new debt.
5. **`CHANGELOG.md` had no prior history.** Was an open item at audit open. **Resolved in this pass.** A dated `2026-06-28 — Quality pass` entry now sits at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`; the `Unreleased` block follows beneath it as before.
6. **Test suite does not catch behavioural regressions.** This is the project's deliberate choice (see [Test coverage limits](#test-coverage-limits-and-future-work) below). Static-grep catches *shape* regressions — a removed export, a renamed helper, a dropped regex, a missing `requireActorContext` call — but not data-flow, timing, or concurrency regressions. AICs (adversarial input testing), runtime tests against `lib/`, and ESLint custom rules (per AUDIT, line 53-55) are still future work.
7. **No static-grep test codifies shell a11y shape.** **Resolved in this pass.** `__tests__/components/shell-a11y.test.mjs` now asserts the four invariants (skip-to-content, sidebar `role="navigation" aria-label="Primary"`, `aria-expanded={open}` on the hamburger, and either `role="alert"` or `aria-live="polite"` on the error/loader path) across all five shells.

## Resolved since 2026-06-21

The following observations appeared in the prior audit snapshot. Each was re-verified against the working tree on 2026-06-28 and was found to be already resolved in code (line numbers below are current).

1. **Monolithic role pages.** Prior audit cited 504-line `app/parent/page.tsx` and ~738-line `app/teacher/page.tsx` / `app/student/page.tsx`. **Resolved.** `app/app/teacher/page.tsx:1-5`, `app/app/parent/page.tsx:1-5`, `app/app/student/page.tsx:1-5` are each 5-line orchestrators delegating to `components/teacher/dashboard/TeacherDashboard.tsx`, etc. (Note: the path changed from `app/teacher/…` to `app/app/teacher/…` along with the namespace consolidation; the prior audit's path is stale.)
2. **`MobileDock` API drift.** Prior audit listed per-shell `isActive` inconsistencies. **Resolved.** `components/workspace/MobileDock.tsx:4-11` defines a single optional `isActive?: (pathname, href) => boolean` prop with a working default. All five shells consume it consistently.
3. **Sidebar width drift.** Prior audit flagged 14rem token vs `w-64` (16rem) conflicts. **Resolved.** All five shells use the `zamschool-workspace-shell__sidebar` token class via `app/globals.css`. No `w-64` / `w-56` sidebar override exists in current shells.
4. **System-wide a11y debt (sidebar `<aside>`, hamburger, skip-to-content).** Prior audit listed no `role="navigation"` on sidebar `<aside>`. **Resolved.** Every shell now has `role="navigation" aria-label="Primary"` on the sidebar (`AdminShell.tsx:285-286`, `ParentShell.tsx:106-107`, `TeacherShell.tsx:123-124`, `StudentShell.tsx:127-128`, `PaymentsShell.tsx:182-183`). Hamburger toggles expose `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`; close overlay buttons expose `aria-label="Close sidebar"`; skip-to-content links render in every shell.
5. **`prefers-reduced-motion` incomplete.** Prior audit listed `animate-enter-up` as unconditionally animating. **Resolved.** `app/globals.css:197-213` neutralizes `.animate-enter-up`, `.workspace-loader-dot`, and `.workspace-loader-ring` under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.
6. **Unread counts go stale in parent/student shells.** Prior audit listed "set once, never re-poll." **Resolved (with nuance).** `ParentShell.tsx:196` and `StudentShell.tsx:228` now seed `WorkspaceInboxCenter` with `initialUnread` from `useWorkspaceContext().unread`. `WorkspaceInboxCenter` is event-driven (subscribes to `INBOX_REFRESH_EVENT`) with a 10-second cooldown refresh — not a poll loop, but functionally equivalent to "re-updates when something happens."
7. **Active-path detection is hand-rolled per shell.** Prior audit listed Set/prefix discrepancies. **Resolved.** All shells now use either `defaultIsActive` from `MobileDock.tsx:69-70` (prefix match) or `lib/workspace-nav.ts` helpers; there is no per-shell hand-roll.
8. **`suppressHydrationWarning` on `<body>`.** Prior audit listed `app/layout.tsx:38` as hiding hydration warnings. **Still present and worth investigating.** Carried forward as a tracked item; not the same as the codebase "drifting away" — this is a deliberate one-time suppression for theme bootstrap that should be narrowed if the cause can be identified.
9. **Leftover static-analysis comment at `AdminShell.tsx:537`.** **Resolved.** No such comment exists in the current source.
10. **Landing page heavy client components.** Listed as resolved in 2026-06-21 originally. **Re-confirmed.** `app/page.tsx` no longer imports `HeroSection` or `ScrollIndicator`.
11. **Two stale test assertions in `/account` and `/admin` route tests.** Listed as resolved in 2026-06-21 originally. **Re-confirmed current** after the cleanup pass.

## Test coverage limits and future work

The test suite is mostly static-grep (one of the project's deliberate choices, noted in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and the README). Static-grep catches structural regressions: a removed export, a renamed helper, a dropped regex assertion, a missing `requireActorContext` call. It does **not** catch:

- **Runtime regressions** — a code path that compiles, has the right token, but produces wrong data.
- **Business-logic correctness** — e.g. a fee calculation that returns `0` for unconfigured rows where it should error.
- **Time-dependent bugs** — e.g. an expiry check that breaks at month boundaries.
- **Schema drift** — column renames in the migrations that the source still references by old name.
- **Concurrency / race conditions** — the in-process hot-read cache, the circuit breaker in `lib/redis.ts`, the offline mutation queue Durable Object.
- **Adversarial inputs** — every assertion above is on a known-good fixture; we don't fuzz inputs, sloppy inputs, or boundary cases.

The exception is the four worker edge tests under `workers/gateway/src/*.test.mjs` and the service worker test under `public/sw.test.mjs`. Those run a small runtime harness with mock KV/R2 — JWT signature verification, rate-limit math, upload authorization, service worker cache strategy. They're real assertions on real code paths.

**Future work, not in scope today:**

- A `__tests__/runtime/` directory with runtime execution tests against the `lib/` modules (mock Supabase/KV as the worker tests do). Start with the most-changed files from the AUDIT "Needs Work" list (the auth/role guards, the rate limiter, `attendance-summary.ts`).
- Property-based or fuzz tests for input validation paths (`lib/payment-input.ts`, the zod schemas).
- ESLint plugin custom rules for the audit checklist items that can be enforced statically (e.g. "API route under `app/api/**/route.ts` must import `requireActorContext` or a role-scoped guard", "service-role query must filter on `school_id`").
- An `npm run audit:refresh` script that walks the cited files and emits a fresh dated snapshot; CI-enforced. **Shipped in the 2026-06-28 quality pass.** `scripts/audit-refresh.mjs` re-reads each cited source file and asserts 11 invariants (design-tokens-centralized, mobile-first-shell, per-role-code-splitting, mobile-dock-typed-contract, prefers-reduced-motion, workspace-context-shell, teacher-workspace-provider, tenant-context-helpers, shell-navigation-aria, shell-skip-to-content, role-page-orchestrators). Exit code 0 means every invariant still matches; non-zero means the author of the audit needs to update line citations in this document. Pair it with the static-grep test at `__tests__/lib/audit-refresh.test.mjs` to prevent the script and its package.json wiring from drifting.
- Shell-level static-grep tests under `__tests__/components/shell-a11y.test.mjs` so a future shell drop cannot regress the a11y shape without failing the suite.

These are significant investments. Until they exist, treat static-grep verdicts as necessary-but-not-sufficient — anything that requires reasoning about data flow or timing should get human review in code review.

## Test Freshness

All 36 inventoried test files (`npm test`, runner at [`scripts/run-tests.mjs`](./../scripts/run-tests.mjs)) were opened and compared against their targeted source or runtime behavior. The runner reports 52 in aggregate because some suites are split into multiple `node:test` files; the table below tracks the 36 distinct source/test pairs the audit personally read. Verdict: **current** if assertions still match, **needs-update** if the assertions are partially out of date, **stale** if the test no longer matches reality. Type: **static** = static-grep (reads source, asserts regex); **runtime** = small runtime harness with mock KV/R2 that exercises real code paths (see the [Test coverage limits](#test-coverage-limits-and-future-work) section above for the trade-off).

Last regenerated: 2026-06-28 after the quality pass.

Compared to the prior audit snapshot (after the 2026-06-28 quality pass):

- 1 new test added to the inventory: `__tests__/components/shell-a11y.test.mjs` codifies the a11y invariants (skip-to-content, `role="navigation"`, `aria-expanded`, `role="alert"`) across all five role shells.
- 6 prior "Needs Work" observations moved to [Resolved since 2026-06-21](#resolved-since-2026-06-21) with confirmed current file/line refs.
- 2 prior unchecked-by-AUDIT items confirmed by re-verification and moved to [Done Well](#done-well) (`MobileDock` typed contract; `prefers-reduced-motion` coverage).

## Implementation Plan

This section tracks the close-out of the residual items in [Needs Work](#needs-work).

### Phase 0 — Audit Doc Reviver (this PR)
- Refresh `docs/AUDIT.md` against current source. ✅ Done in this commit.
- Update test inventory with the new shell-a11y static-grep test. ✅ Done in this commit.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` to record this pass with a dated entry. ✅ Done in this commit.
- Mark the boundary between `WorkspaceContextProvider` and `TeacherWorkspaceProvider` in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. ✅ Done in this commit.

### Phase 1 — One-line shell fix
- ✅ Done in this commit. `components/TeacherShell.tsx:298` now carries `role="alert"` on the `workspaceError` rose banner.

### Phase 2 — Shell a11y invariant test
- ✅ Done in this commit. `__tests__/components/shell-a11y.test.mjs` runs 4 assertions × 5 shells = 20 invariant checks. All passing locally as part of `npm test`.

### Phase 3 — Audit refresh automation (foundation shipped)
- ✅ Done in this commit. `scripts/audit-refresh.mjs` re-reads each cited source file and asserts 11 invariants. `npm run audit:refresh` returned all-pass at 2026-06-28T10:40:32.036Z. `__tests__/lib/audit-refresh.test.mjs` pins the wiring. CI integration is the next step (turn the `npm run audit:refresh` exit code into a merge gate).

### Phase 4 — `lib/` subdomain grouping (pilot shipped; bulk migration open)
- **Pilot shipped in this commit.** The `lib/redis-*` cluster (6 files) has been moved into `lib/redis/`. New paths:
  - `lib/redis.ts` → `lib/redis/client.ts`
  - `lib/redis-keys.ts` → `lib/redis/keys.ts`
  - `lib/redis-role-cache.ts` → `lib/redis/role-cache.ts`
  - `lib/redis-session.ts` → `lib/redis/session.ts`
  - `lib/redis-temp.ts` → `lib/redis/temp.ts`
  - `lib/redis-ttl.ts` → `lib/redis/ttl.ts`
  All in-tree imports (`app/api/account/shell/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/send-otp/route.ts`, and 7 files under `lib/`) have been rewritten to match. The pilot validates the convention before the larger `lib/` migration.
- **Foundation shipped.** `eslint-rules/lib-subdomain-policy.mjs` is the lint guard. New top-level files in `lib/` whose name is not on the legacy allow-list (`eslint-rules/lib-legacy-whitelist.json`) emit a warning with the suggested subdomain. Codified by `__tests__/lib/lib-subdomain-policy.test.mjs` (3 assertions: well-formed allow-list, coverage of all current top-level files, and the rule actually firing on a sentinel file).
- **Bulk migration still open.** Approximately 140 remaining top-level `lib/` files, grouped by naming-prefix into ~15 subdomains per the table in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`. Each migration PR should: move a cluster, rewrite imports, and remove the moved basenames from the allow-list. The redis pilot is the template.

### Phase 5 — Per-role settings pages (principal shipped; others open)
- **Principal shipped in this commit.** `app/app/principal/settings/page.tsx` is a 5-line orchestrator delegating to `AccountSettingsPage` with `accent="indigo"`. The principal's `Account` section in `lib/workspace-nav.ts` was rewired from `/app/settings` to `/app/principal/settings`. Codified by `__tests__/components/principal-settings.test.mjs`.
- **Loading error contract.** `lib/account-portal-api.ts` now prefers `body.cause || body.error` when throwing, so dev/staging toasts carry the real cause (e.g. a column-name mismatch) instead of the literal `"Failed to load session"`. The API at `app/api/account/session/route.ts` populates `cause` from `safeErrorMessage(error, fallback)` and logs the underlying error to the dev console. The clients at `components/account/AccountSettingsPage.tsx` mirror that log in non-prod. Prod stays generic so internal column names do not leak. Codified by two of the four assertions in `__tests__/components/principal-settings.test.mjs`.
- **Other admin subtypes open.** The same accent inconsistency affects deputy-head, bursar, guidance, hr-admin, ict-admin, academic-admin, discipline-admin, registrar, payments, and super-admin. Each needs a dedicated `app/app/<role>/settings/page.tsx` orchestrator and a `lib/workspace-nav.ts` rewrite for that role's `Account` section. The matching accent for each role is the one used by its respective workspace page (`accent` prop).
