# ZamSchool OS

ZamSchool OS is a school administration platform for Zambia. You use it to manage classes, subjects, timetables, attendance, results, fees, messaging, and announcements. The application is multi-tenant: every school is a tenant, every user belongs to one school, every query is scoped to a school.

The documentation set is small and focused. You should read these in order:

1. [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — stack, layers, data flow, roles.
2. [UI-UX.md](./docs/UI-UX.md) — shell patterns, component conventions, design tokens, accessibility, responsiveness.
3. [DATA.md](./docs/DATA.md) — Postgres, migrations, caching, indexes, files.
4. [SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md) — RLS, auth, service-role policy, MFA, rate limiting, audit.
5. [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — setup, commands, branching, PR checklist.
6. [PRODUCTION.md](./docs/PRODUCTION.md) — readiness gates, sign-off, rollback.
7. [OPERATIONS.md](./docs/OPERATIONS.md) — DR drills, load tests, incidents.
8. [CHANGELOG.md](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) — notable changes.
9. [AUDIT.md](./docs/AUDIT.md) — frontend audit findings and test freshness.

## Stack

You are looking at a Next.js 16 application using the App Router, Tailwind 4 for styling, and Supabase for auth, database, and storage. The runtime is Node.js for the Next.js server plus a Cloudflare Worker for the edge gateway under `workers/gateway/`. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, standalone output)
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Charts**: Recharts, React Big Calendar
- **Forms**: React Hook Form, Zod 4
- **Image CDN**: Cloudflare R2
- **Edge cache**: Cloudflare

## Getting started

You need Node.js, a Supabase project, and (optionally) a Cloudflare R2 bucket.

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the Supabase URL, anon key, and (if you need the strict tenant audit locally) the service role key. Add R2 credentials if you are working on uploads.
3. Apply migrations in lexical order from `supabase/migrations/`. The directory currently ships one baseline (92 tables, all RLS-enabled) plus targeted repairs; new schema changes go in next migrations in the same folder. See [DATA.md](./docs/DATA.md) for the policy.
4. `npm run dev` — start the Next.js server on port 3000.
5. `npx wrangler tail` / `npx wrangler deploy` — if you are working on the gateway worker. Run `npm run cloudflare:status` for the connection helper.

## Project structure

- `app/` — App Router pages and API routes. The authenticated workspace lives under `app/app/*`; the public landing is `app/page.tsx`; auth edges are `app/login/*`, `app/first-login/*`, `app/error.tsx`.
- `app/api/*` — API routes. Every route uses `requireActorContext` or a role-scoped guard.
- `components/` — shells, sidebars, header, dock, modals, widgets. Side components co-locate with their owning shell.
- `lib/` — pure helpers: `admin-route-client`, `gateway-read-client`, `workspace-nav`, `workspace-search`, auth and rate-limit helpers.
- `hooks/` — `use-mobile`, `useReveal`, and other micro-hooks.
- `supabase/migrations/` — baseline + targeted repairs, applied in lexical order.
- `scripts/` — healthcheck, route coverage audit, migrations applier, CDN preflight, dev-server helper.
- `workers/gateway/` — Cloudflare Worker for edge reads.
- `__tests__/` — static-grep tests. See [AUDIT.md](./docs/AUDIT.md) for the freshness audit.

## Common commands

You will use these most often:

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server.
- `npm run build` and `npm run start` — production build and run.
- `npm test` — run all static-grep + worker edge tests under `__tests__/` and `workers/gateway/src/`.
- `npm run test:all` — alias for `npm test`.
- `npm run test:security` — security-focused subset: tenant audit + worker JWT/rate-limit tests + MFA/session-switch/files route tests.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint across the repo.
- `npm run schema:check` / `npm run schema:check:strict` — verify migrations (required tables, RLS coverage, no duplicates).
- `npm run audit:tenant` / `npm run audit:tenant:strict` — service-role tenant isolation audit.
- `npm run audit:routes` — route coverage audit (lists mutation routes missing auth, feature checks, or audit logs).
- `npm run load:test:smoke` / `:tier1` / `:tier2` / `:tier3` / `:dry` — load tests at four tiers.
- `npm run cloudflare:status` / `:cache-rules` / `:discover-r2` / `:r2-test` — Cloudflare Worker and R2 helpers.
- `npm run healthcheck` — run the production healthcheck.
- `npm run cdn:preflight` — validate Cloudflare R2 / image-delivery config before deploy.
- `npm run clean` — blow away `.next` and `.next_broken_*` build artifacts.
- `npm run dev:restart` — Windows-only: tear down the dev server and restart it.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the day-to-day workflow and [PRODUCTION.md](./docs/PRODUCTION.md) for the readiness story.

## Roles

The system supports 14 roles with role-based shells and route prefixes. The active roles in production are admin, principal, teacher, parent, student, and payments (bursar); admin subtypes include super_admin, guidance_office, discipline_admin, it_admin, and auditor. Unknown roles fall back to the admin shell. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#roles-and-routes) for the full list and [SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md) for the authorization model.

## Security

You should treat every page as if it were public. RLS is enabled on every production table; service-role queries are audited by `npm run audit:tenant:strict` (CI-enforced). MFA is TOTP-based with fail-closed rate limiting. See [SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md) for the threat model and the layers.
